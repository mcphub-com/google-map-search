# Aigeon AI Google Map Search

Aigeon AI Google Map Search is a Python-based server application designed to facilitate the scraping of Google Maps data. This tool leverages the SerpApi service to perform detailed searches on Google Maps, providing users with the ability to customize their search queries using various parameters.

## Features Overview

- **Google Maps Data Scraping**: Efficiently scrape data from Google Maps using the SerpApi service.
- **Customizable Search Queries**: Tailor your search queries with various parameters such as location, language, and domain.
- **Pagination Support**: Navigate through search results with pagination options.
- **Cache Management**: Control caching behavior to optimize search performance and manage API usage.
- **Asynchronous Search Submission**: Optionally submit searches asynchronously to retrieve results at a later time.

## Main Features and Functionality

The application is built around a single primary function that interacts with the SerpApi to perform Google Maps searches. This function is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to specify a wide range of parameters to refine their search results.

### Main Function: `search_map`

The `search_map` function is the core of the application, enabling users to perform searches on Google Maps with a variety of customizable parameters. Below is a detailed description of its parameters:

- **`q`**: (string) The query parameter defines the search term you want to use, similar to a regular Google Maps search.
  
- **`ll`**: (string, optional) Specifies the GPS coordinates for the search origin. The format should be `@latitude,longitude,zoom`, where the zoom level ranges from 3 (zoomed out) to 21 (zoomed in).

- **`google_domain`**: (string, optional) Defines the Google domain to use for the search, defaulting to `google.com`. Users can specify other domains based on their needs.

- **`gl`**: (string, optional) Sets the country code for the search, allowing users to target specific geographical regions.

- **`hl`**: (string, optional) Determines the language for the search results, using a two-letter language code.

- **`start`**: (int, optional) Manages result pagination by specifying the result offset. On desktop, this should be a multiple of 20, while on mobile, it should be a multiple of 10.

- **`no_cache`**: (bool, optional) Controls whether to use cached results. Setting this to `true` forces a fresh fetch from SerpApi, bypassing any cached results.

- **`aasync`**: (bool, optional) Defines the submission mode for the search. When set to `true`, the search is submitted asynchronously, allowing results to be retrieved later via the Searches Archive API.

The function constructs a payload with the provided parameters and sends a GET request to the SerpApi endpoint. The response is returned in JSON format, containing the search results.

This tool is ideal for developers and data analysts looking to integrate Google Maps data into their applications or perform detailed geographic data analysis.
